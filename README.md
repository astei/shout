# Shout!

Shout! is a modern announcement plugin for Minecraft.

## Supported platforms

* Bukkit (at least Spigot 1.8.8)
  * Paper recommended
* BungeeCord (all versions with 1.7 support and above)
  * Waterfall/Travertine recommended
* Sponge (WIP, at least Sponge 7)
* Velocity (requires Velocity 1.1.0 or above)

## Features

* Basic announcement functionality
* Support for legacy, JSON, and MiniMessage formats

## Goals

Shout has two primary goals:

* The world's **best** announcement plugin for Minecraft, packed with features
* Incredibly **portable**, with a goal of less than 500 lines of platform-specific code per platform
  * As long as `adventure-platform` supports the platform (or the platform supports `adventure` directly such as Velocity 1.1.0+), Shout can support it too
